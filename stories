The gap between it and Central-Phenix City has narrowed as the No. 1 Red Devils have 189 points and nine first-place votes, just six more points than the Warriors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThompson continued its undefeated run through region play with a 56-10 win in its final regular-season home game against Hillcrest-Tuscaloosa, which received one top-10 vote in this week’s poll. The Warriors are now 5-0 in Class 7A, Region 3 and need just one win in their last two to clinch the region title.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat can come on Oct. 17 when Thompson takes on perennial rival Hoover in a showdown at the Hoover Met. The Bucs enter the matchup as the No. 8 team in Class 7A and fresh off of a 51-7 win over winless Tuscaloosa County on Thursday, Oct. 9.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpain Park held on to its No. 9 spot with 40 points in the poll, 10 more than No. 10 Homewood and eight less than No. 8 Pike Road. It’s now the team’s third-straight week at No. 9.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Jags took their record to 5-2 with their third-straight win, a 44-7 region victory over the Chelsea Hornets. Spain Park scored the final 44 points unanswered and has now outscored its last three opponents 114-21.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Jags will look to continue their winning ways with their final road game of the regular season on Oct. 17 against the Calera Eagles at Ricky Cairns Stadium. The Eagles enter the matchup at 2-5 but have won their last two games against Brookwood and Chilton County.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVincent maintained its No. 10 spot in Class 2A with 21 points in the poll, eight more than Goshen, the top unranked vote-getter in the classification, and 21 less points than No. 9 Ariton.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Jackets bounced back from a Week 7 loss to Tuscaloosa Academy with a 27-0 win over Aliceville on Oct. 10. It was Vincent’s first shutout of the season and came with a backup quarterback in junior Landon Archer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Jackets enter Week 8 in second place in Class 2A, Region 5 on a tiebreaker over Sulligent. Vincent will look to gain separation in a crowded top four when it travels to another top-four region team in the Isabella Mustangs on Oct. 17.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, Patrician took over the No. 1 spot in the AISA after defeating previous No. 1 Chambers Academy in Week 8. No other changes occurred this week, but a major battle atop 5A will take place on Oct. 17 between No. 1 Vigor and No. 2 Williamson.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the full rankings for each classification, read more below:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Alabama Sports Writers Association high school football rankings with first-place votes, win-loss record and total poll points:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECLASS 7A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeam (first-place); W-L; Pts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECentral-Phenix City (9); 7-1; 189\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThompson (8); 6-2; 183\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMary Montgomery (1); 8-0; 148\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EVestavia Hills; 5-2; 111\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAuburn; 6-2; 96\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDaphne; 7-1; 89\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHewitt-Trussville; 6-2; 69\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHoover; 5-3; 50\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECarver-Montgomery; 5-2; 40\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOpelika; 6-2; 32\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOthers receiving votes:\u003C/strong\u003E Austin (5-2) 6, Baker (5-2) 5, Huntsville (5-2) 4, Dothan (4-3) 2, Fairhope (6-2) 1, Hillcrest-Tuscaloosa (5-3) 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECLASS 6A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeam (first-place); W-L; Pts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EClay-Chalkville (17); 8-0; 213\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESaraland (1); 7-0; 161\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMuscle Shoals; 7-0; 126\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHartselle; 7-0; 117\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EParker; 6-2; 115\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBenjamin Russell; 6-1; 99\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERussell Co.; 7-0; 64\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPike Road; 6-2; 48\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESpain Park; 5-2; 40\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHomewood; 6-1; 30\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOthers receiving votes:\u003C/strong\u003E Fort Payne (6-1) 7, McAdory (5-1) 3, Jasper (6-1) 2, Theodore (5-2) 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECLASS 5A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeam (first-place); W-L; Pts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EVigor (16); 7-0; 209\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWilliamson (1); 8-0; 163\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMoody (1); 6-2; 135\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFairview; 7-0; 124\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECentral-Clay Co.; 7-1; 112\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENorthside; 8-0; 97\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESt. Clair Co.; 6-1; 60\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECorner; 6-1; 46\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGuntersville; 6-1; 32\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAndalusia; 6-2; 19\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOthers receiving votes:\u003C/strong\u003E Ramsay (4-3) 15, Priceville (5-2) 4, Carver-Birmingham (4-1) 3, Jacksonville (5-3) 3, Boaz (6-1) 2, Scottsboro (5-3) 2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECLASS 4A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETeam (first-place); W-L; Pts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESt. Michael (17); 7-0; 213\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EJackson; 6-2; 151\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWest Morgan (1); 7-0; 143\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnniston; 7-0; 131\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMadison Aca.; 6-1; 86\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECherokee Co.; 6-2; 82\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPlainview; 7-0; 63\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHamilton; 8-0; 54\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDeshler; 7-0; 41\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGood Hope; 6-1; 29\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOthers receiving votes:\u003C/strong\u003E Alexandria (6-1) 13, Opp (6-1) 9, Handley (7-1) 7, Bullock Co.

Nothing matters up to today, and from here on out, it&#8217;s all about, ‘How much better have you gotten during the season, and can you stick together as a team, overcome the adversity that comes with the playoffs?’ So we’ve got a lot of matches we got to win to get where we want to get to.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the first match against Central-Clay County, Briarwood had a single-digit lead at the midway point but quickly grew it into a commanding one. Stella Woods secured two aces on the serve to push the Lions to an 18-7 lead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EService errors prevented the Lions from wrapping up the set sooner, but Briarwood worked quickly on the side out to regain control and put it away. The Lions secured the 25-10 first-set win off a Peyton Gibbons ace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBriarwood went on a tear to start the second set as Leighton Hendley got a kill to kick off a 9-0 run. Noelle Suellentrop was the driving force with four aces of her nine points at the service line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Lions continued rolling over the course of the set, extending the lead to 21-3. The hosts were largely comfortable in the set and conceded most of their points off service errors, but Stella Woods got a dramatic diving dig for the 13-1 lead. The teams traded serve down the stretch before Briarwood ended the 25-6 win at the net with a kill.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third set was the most competitive of the entire match. After Hendley got three aces in an 8-2 run, Central raced back into the match and cut the lead to 11-8. The Vols continued to hang close at 14-10 before a Lainey Woods-led 5-0 run put Briarwood up 19-10.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat proved to be the dagger as the Lions sealed the sweep with a Gibbons kill for the 25-13 victory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter Sylacauga swept Shelby County 3-0 to reach the finals, Briarwood pulled away in the first set with a 12-1 run to open the match. Leighton Hendley was just one of multiple key contributors thanks to multiple aces and a strong kill early on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA misplaced pass gave the Aggies the serve, and Sylacauga took advantage by winning three-straight points. An ace capped the short run to make it 12-4, but Clara Crawford grabbed a block to end the threat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBriarwood’s front row continued to dominate down the stretch as the Lions ended the set on a 12-3 run. That included the last four points as Hendley secured a side out kill to spark the closing rally, and she ended the 25-7 win with another kill following one of the longest rallies of the first set.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like the opening frame, the Lions raced ahead in the second set with a 7-0 run to start, but the Aggies made it a close affair coming out of a timeout. Sylacauga cut the gap to 11-7 before Briarwood took back over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Lions resumed their dominant form as Roberts and Lainey Woods controlled the service line. Roberts landed back-to-back aces during her stint, and Lainey Woods one-upped her with three-consecutive aces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBriarwood went up 22-8, but while most of their previous runs ended with service errors, Sylacauga strung together more points in the final stretch. The Aggies briefly drew within 10 as the Lions misplaced a few balls, but Sylacauga hit one out of bounds to give Briarwood the 25-14 second-set win and 2-0 match lead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third set was a back-and-forth battle to start. After the Lions went up 3-0 to begin, the Aggies didn’t let Briarwood get more than a couple of points in front. Up 8-6, the Lions grabbed hold of the momentum and forced a timeout with a Coley Barnes block for the 10-6 lead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBriarwood kept rolling out of the timeout as Roberts took the lead to 13-6. However, Sylacauga then won three out of the next four points to draw back within four.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s when the Lions made their move. A 6-0 run put the hosts in front 20-10 and effectively iced the game. Even though the Aggies went on two short runs to win five more points, Briarwood sealed the sweep and 25-15 win with a Hendley ace to clinch the championship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAcross the two matches, Suellentrop had 39 assists, 11 aces and eight digs while Roberts earned nine kills and 11 digs and Crawford had 15 kills and four total blocks. Hendley led the offense with 17 digs while also securing a team-high 12 aces, and Lainey Woods had eight aces and six digs on the evening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn’t all positives on the night as Gibbons exited in the first set against Sylacauga after an awkward landing from a block and did not return. With injuries starting to stack up, Camper hopes to use the next eight days to get his players right and finetune the areas they need to advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“We&#8217;ve got to figure out the lineup, get kids back in the lineup, and figure out what we&#8217;re going to do when we get down there,” Camper said. “So, it&#8217;s all details. Just focus on the little things, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do over the next couple of days.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBriarwood is now 34-6 heading into the Class 5A South Super Regionals, where it will face the Area 2 runner-up on Wednesday, Oct. 22 at 2 p.m. at the Cramton Bowl Multiplex. A win will put them into a playoff match later that day for a spot in the Elite Eight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECamper believes that momentum is on his team’s side after sweeping the area and overcoming a difficult schedule. He hopes said momentum can carry them deeper than Briarwood has been in years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“(Volleyball’s) such a huge momentum sport,” Camper said. “I think the girls feel good about the way we&#8217;re playing. And, we&#8217;ve been to Montgomery before, but this program, it’s been a while since they&#8217;ve won two games down there and gotten to the Elite Eight. So the girls are excited. They know they’ve got two tough matches, and I think momentum&#8217;s the biggest thing we can take from them.”\u003C/p\u003E\n",

To commemorate Khalia’s memory, a bench has been dedicated to her at Lee Springs Park.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA ceremony was held to celebrate the occasion at the park on Saturday, Oct. 11, at noon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFamily and friends came together to be a part of the occasion and share fond memories of their friend and loved one while reflecting on the impact Khalia had.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“It just overwhelms my heart that people came to support,” said LaQuita Perry, Khalia’s mother. “Everybody was on one accord, celebrating the legacy she left and knowing how special she is. That’s what made the day so special.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe outpouring of support Khalia’s family has received is not something they take lightly, and they were pleased to have the opportunity to be around many of them while celebrating her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Today was an emotional day, but God told us to praise him and give him the glory,” said DiAngelo Perry, Khalia’s father. “Knowing that she shines down on us, it was a blessed day. We were honored to be with people that supported us and cared for us and showed us love on this day to dedicate this bench and celebrate her legacy. We really appreciate them, we appreciate the city of Helena.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen DiAngelo and LaQuita became aware of just how many people Khalia impacted, they knew they wanted to provide a way for others to remember her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA park bench was a fitting way to honor her, as the park is a place where her family loves to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“All the support we got, all the calls, the overwhelming stories about how she touched people’s lives, we just felt that we needed to do something to leave here, right where we’re a part of, in the city of Helena,” Perry said. “That was a special way to do that. The parks, the outdoors, that’s what our family loves to do. It just made sense to do it. It went with who we are, and it was a beautiful way to commemorate her lasting impact.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKhalia’s family was honored to have some of the people who did everything in their power to support them present at the ceremony.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Some people showed personal care, that was really important, that was really a blessing to us,” DiAngelo said. “Some people went out of their way to show us love and support.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKhalia’s parents are working to establish the Khalia Michelle Smith Foundation, which will provide mental health advocacy and scholarships, two things she was passionate about. To keep up with the journey, visit ImpactofKhalia.org.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“That’s a beautiful legacy to show love to all people,” LaQuita said. “It’s showing the love of Jesus, to have that in the world is so needed. Love is the biggest thing we have to give, and in the end, it’s all that will matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The first one authorized Mayor Frank Brocato to execute an agreement with Alabama Power Company for a utility easement. Meanwhile, the second one authorized Brocato to execute a prepayment of goods and services for the park&#8217;s power restoration, while the third one amended the budget for the 2025 fiscal year for the repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe park&#8217;s electricity has been shut off since early in the year due to multiple reports since 2024 that electrical currents were being detected in fences around the park. As a result, the city hired Dewberry Engineering to investigate the issue, who found that damaged cables were causing electrical cables to be sent into fences around the park, not just in one area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn August, the council approved an amendment of the city&#8217;s budget for about $350,000 to pay for the identification of the problems, and in September, approved for $500,000 to be spent on the first phase of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the Oct. 13 meeting, the Hoover City Council voted to approve a spending amount of about $3,675,000 in order to replace the lighting at the complex, helping to complete the second phase of the project and finish the full redesign of the park&#8217;s electrical layout.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on this for several months,&#8221; said Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato. &#8220;It was an incredible problem. It was a dangerous situation, and we had to just be very, very sure before we made any type of move, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s taken so long. We had to bring in consultants, engineers, electrical engineers; we had to evaluate the entire park.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the investigation to find out the problems complete and the prices for this project approved, the city will now move forward to get this project done so the complex can get back to hosting games in the evening hours.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;It isn&#8217;t just isolated to one spot. It was very unusual and it affected the entire park,&#8221; Brocato said. &#8220;Now that we know what the problem is, we can make some incredible improvements that are going to be special. It&#8217;s going to be worth the wait the way I see it, because the lighting system will be much better&#8230; It&#8217;ll be a great improvement, and as far as the city is concerned, it&#8217;s will be quite a savings on our electrical bill as well, so it&#8217;s a good project.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrocato added that the new electricity improvements will help bring better lighting to the dugouts at the park, as well as better electrical outlets so that parts of the park that were not receiving as much of the electricity and lighting could now do so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the Hoover City Council also approved a change order for an Alabama Department of Transportation project of the new interchange near Exit 9 on Interstate 459 for $232,000. The change order comes as a result of some items were recommended as improvements that were not included in the initial design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrocato heavily discussed the project during his State of the City address back in January, in which he said that the &#8220;diverging diamond&#8221; concept will affect Bessemer, Helena, Hoover and Birmingham and would cost $120 million, which is a price being split with ALDOT.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe council also approved a resolution to authorize Central Alabama Water to install fire hydrants at multiple locations in The Foothills of Blackridge.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

For a free event, it really impressed with music, activities and vendors.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESouthtown Revival got the weekend’s festivities started with a performance at 6 p.m. on Friday. The ’77 Experience took the stage at 8 p.m., closing out the festival’s opening night.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGates reopened at 10 a.m. on Saturday, and Swamp Poppas promptly took the stage to resume the weekend’s selection of live music. The Helena High School Jazz Band performed at noon. Margeaux and The Cat’s Meow had a set beginning at 1:15 p.m., Erin Black performed at 3:15 p.m. and The Only’s went on at 4 p.m.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECashBack, serving as the event’s headlining act, closed out Saturday with a set that began at 6 p.m.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESaturday was a special day in Helena, as the City Council previously passed an ordinance to declare Oct. 11 “Jack Gray Day,” honoring his service to the festival and the city of Helena as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGray, who passed away in May, served as the “duck wrangler” for many years, making it a fitting honor to name the race after him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of work goes into making the festival happen each year, and a dedicated team works with Harman to help plan everything out and ensure the event goes as smoothly as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“So proud of this team of people that meets year-round to plan and put this all together,” Harman said. “Words can’t express how thankful I am for them and the volunteers that join in to help the weekend of the event. We truly couldn’t do it without the community support.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the festival begins and Harman and the rest of the team have the opportunity to see their hard work pay off right in front of them, all of the preparation becomes worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Watching the constant flow of people coming in the entrance—seeing their smiles and hearing their laughter, that’s what makes it all worth it,” Harman said.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The plan—submitted by BriMark Builders LA, LLC, on behalf of Cobblestone Hotels and the city of Montevallo—calls for the hotel to be built at 555 Main Street, at the southwest corner of Main and Shelby streets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMayor Rusty Nix noted that the project has received approvals from every relevant city body, including the Design Review Committee, Planning and Zoning Commission and the Arbor and Beautification Board.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“This has been approved by the Design Review Committee, this has been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The landscaping has been approved by the Arbor and Beautification Board,” Nix said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECouncilperson Kenny Dukes expressed enthusiasm about the project’s impact on downtown Montevallo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“This hotel is going to be an asset; it’s a beautiful facility designed to fit within our downtown corridor, and I think it’s going to be a wonderful asset to the city of Montevallo moving forward,” Dukes said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Cobblestone Hotel and Suites will feature 54 rooms, hot breakfast, high-speed internet, a swimming pool, meeting areas, a business center and a conference room.

I&#8217;ve talked with Dr. (Terry) Roberson over at the university. They&#8217;ve already gone through their process. So right now, Trey (Gauntt) and his team are putting together the description of properties, the full property descriptions and the contract is being done through Butch (Ellis&#8217;) office.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe property that is being purchased is located within Highway 10 and Highway 204, and contains182.8 acres costs $1,280,000, a price that was within the budgeted expenditures for the 2026 fiscal year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe property contains the University of Montevallo Lake, the old caretaker&#8217;s house, old storage space and an old clubhouse. It was also previously utilized as a golf course.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the purchased property contains an old competition mountain bike course, which, according to Scroggins, will help to be a key asset for the county as they look to revitalize the land under its ownership.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Being able to recruit more events into the University of Montevallo area and the city of Montevallo is important, and so we&#8217;ll be able to utilize that mountain bike course,&#8221; Scroggins said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has also been highly requested in recent times by Montevallo residents and officials for a trail network to be developed for the surrounding neighborhood to use. Scroggins added on that it could also develop into a nice cross country course for the county to use that may also be a solid opportunity for tourism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe property will now contain signage that reflects the partnership between the city of Montevallo, the university and Shelby County, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to approval of the purchasing, the Shelby County Commission also passed a proclamation to declare October 2025 as Domestic Violence Awareness Month in order to raise awareness for the issue and encourage citizens to help support survivors and create a community environment where all people can live free from fear and violence.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

      "rendered": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBy DANIEL LOCKE | Staff Writer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time since Helena High School opened in 2014, the baseball program needed a new head coach. Who did the Huskies turn to? A 12-year MLB first baseman who won a Gold Glove and a World Series championship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the sun rises on opening day of the Huskies’ 2026 campaign, they will be under the leadership of Mitch Moreland, who played for the Texas Rangers and Boston Red Sox, where he earned his Gold Glove in 2016 and was part of the team that won the 2018 World Series, before finishing with the San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter his playing career came to an end in 2021, Moreland’s life had a hole in it. The game that everything had revolved around was absent, and it needed to play a role once again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I’ve been out of the game for a couple years, and really the last year or two, got to where I missed it a lot,” Moreland said. “I missed just being around the boys and the field in general. I’ve coached my kids, which are a younger age group, a good bit over the last few years, and that’s been fun, but it’s just something about the competitive side of it. Being able to be around the game in a little more advanced setting that I was missing.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreland is not a completely new face to the Helena High baseball program or the community. He moved to Helena along with his wife Susannah, a Shelby County native who grew up in Columbiana, and children Crue, Swayze and Ledger before his career in the majors came to an end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe has volunteered with the baseball program previously, and when the opportunity to lead it presented itself, he felt the timing was right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I volunteered last year with Helena and had a blast with that,” Moreland said. “This happened fast here, but the job came open here in Helena, which is where we live and what we call home. We’re pretty rooted in the community, and obviously, I was excited about having a chance to take over and try to change these boys’ lives by creating good young men and good ball players.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Morelands were drawn to Helena by a similar aspect of the city that has led to countless other families calling it home over the years: the small-town feel mixed with outstanding schools and a tight-knit community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Probably The Depot, the waterfall, everything Helena is as far as a small town goes,” Moreland said. “We love the people here, we love the community. It’s a great place to raise a family. We have three kids here, and two of them are in the school system, my wife teaches here. We’re pretty involved and just love being here.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHelena has enjoyed a good amount of success in the 11 seasons since the program began. Now, it’s under the leadership of someone who has a better understanding of what success looks like in the sport than just about anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of 2025, only 151 of the 351 members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame have earned a World Series ring. For any player to have that opportunity is a massive accomplishment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“There are really no words you can put to winning a World Series,” Moreland said. “There are probably four things I’ve done in my life that beat that: marrying my wife and the birth of my kids. Winning the World Series is a completely different feel. I spent my whole life trying to get to that point. I feel like that’s the pinnacle of baseball, playing in the major leagues and being on a great team and having that opportunity. I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to play in three and to win one. There’s no way to describe it. It’s pretty special.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreland’s experience as a veteran in the MLB, where he was responsible for helping young players adjust to the game at that level, gives him valuable insight into effective coaching techniques, something he plans to take advantage of with the Huskies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I feel like when I got to the major leagues, I had a lot to learn about the game,” Moreland said. “Turning from that young rookie into a veteran guy that young guys came to and leaned on, I always enjoyed that mentorship role. I love that as much as I did playing the game at the end. The fact that the guys respected me enough to listen to what I had to say, it’s a different feeling and something I really enjoyed. I think that’s something I can carry into this coaching role. There’s no greater calling than that. There’s no better way to give back, and that’s something I’m really excited about.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreland learned a lot throughout his baseball career, but one of the most important lessons was how to handle adversity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom problems that come up on the field to things his players will deal with after their time on the diamond comes to an end, instilling that ability to overcome tough circumstances into his players is a priority for Moreland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I’m huge on adversity and just figuring out a way to keep pushing forward,” Moreland said. “The adversity fight this game teaches you, you deal with in everyday life. One thing I’ve noticed being out is how much the game helped me prepare for stuff off the field. If I can give the guys a head start on that, that’ll be a win for us. I just want them to be ready to take on what life throws at them.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile he plans on incorporating some of the ways he was coached as a major leaguer into Helena’s day-to-day routine, he understands he is dealing with a different level of players. Despite their age, Moreland will have a high standard for his team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, he is prepared for the learning process that is to come with coaching high school ball for the first time and is confident his players will respond well, even if it comes with some adversity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I think we’re going to have to be a little more fundamental in some ways, but I will also be holding these guys accountable and treating them like men from an early age,” Moreland said. “I’m going to ask them to grow up and mature quicker than they might need to, but it’s for the right reasons, and I’m looking forward to seeing how they take it. I’ll be learning with them, it’s a new experience for me as well. It’ll be a transition for us, and hopefully we can make it as smooth as possible.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest on-field lessons Moreland learned as a player is the importance of preparation. He believes his job, and that of his assistants, is to put his players in a position where they have encountered any situation that could pop up as many times as possible during practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I always prided myself in being prepared, preparation is key,” Moreland said. “Whatever situation you get in during a game, if you’ve already covered that in game speed at practice, I feel like you’re going to be ahead of the curve. The more times you can make that play or succeed in that situation, the better and calmer your team is going to be. If you can play the game with a slow heartbeat, you can win a lot.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Helena enters a new era under Moreland, the community will have a chance to watch a team coached by a player who has had success at the highest level. From game preparation to life preparation, he plans to make a lasting impact in the program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreland enjoys calling Helena home, and he is eager to impact it the best way he knows how: on the diamond.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The International 2025, the annual world championship of Dota 2, is all set to occupy Hamburg, Germany, between 4 and 14 September 2025. Sixteen of the premier teams worldwide will battle it out to the end to win the Aegis of Champions and a multimillion-dollar prize pool. The International (TI) is the culmination of Dota 2 professional gaming, an event that has grown to epitomize the profession over the last decade-plus, and it will feature new elements in terms of format, variety of regions represented, and unique ways of engaging fans.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EA Revamped Format for TI 2025\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EThrough format changes, Valve (Dota 2 creator) once again intends to make competition more fair and exciting.

Each team will play the best -of -three against a team of equal record. Teams that gather four victories will enter the Playoffs, whereas those teams that have failed by gaining four losses are disqualified.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EAfter this, there is the Special Elimination Round, wherein the 10 remaining teams are again given one last chance of securing their places in the Playoffs.

Each pass will consist of best of three matches except the Grand Finals, which rests on the heady best of five.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EThe Teams: Global Champions Converge\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003ETI 2025 features an even mix of direct invites and regional qualifier champions, creating a balance between established juggernauts and new competition that will emerge. These 16 teams represent all six major regions of professional Dota 2. Popular teams, such as Team Spirit, the TI 2021 champions, and Gaimin Gladiators, who have been the dominant force over the last two years, will face off against hungry underdogs like HEROIC and Wildcard. The combination guarantees plotlines of dynasties having to protect their historic line against fresh competitors wanting to make their mark in the history of Dota

established through base funding of up to US$1.6 million, as well as community crowdfunding through the Compendiums and in-game content. Although it is not quite decided how much is at stake in TI 2025, history indicates tens of millions of dollars.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003ETraditionally, the champions receive 45 percent of the prize pool making a win at The International one of the most rewarding in all esports. The reintroduction of a supporter pack and a compendium-like fundraising effort is directly allowing fans to directly assist the tournament in its financial stakes.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EWhy TI Still Matters\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EThe International is not just an esports event since its inception in 2011: it has been a cultural phenomenon. Not only does it name the world champions of Dota 2 each year but it also shapes the competitive meta of the game, leaving lasting memories in gaming minds and game legends.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EAnd in 2025, the stakes are bigger than ever. Structure revisions equalizing the contenders, the alliance of game-old marvels and new angles, and community-inspired option money pools make Hamburg an International that will have the potential to compete with the history-making situations that have been witnessed in previous years.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003EGamble Responsibly.
